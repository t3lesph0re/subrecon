I want to update all the source files in this repo. Do NOT delete any existing files. Create a git branch called "v2" first.

1. Replace src/recon_chain.py with:
- ASCII banner on startup
- Add optional subfinder support (run alongside assetfinder, dedupe results in memory)
- Remove shell=True from all subprocess calls — use list args instead
- Replace manual sys.argv parsing with argparse (add -v short flag for --verbose)
- Check that required tools (assetfinder, dnsx, httpx) exist before running, exit with clear message if missing
- Eliminate subs_raw.txt intermediate — dedupe in memory, write subs.txt directly
- Print counts at each step (e.g. "Found 200 unique subdomains → subs.txt")
- Keep the same output files: subs.txt, resolved.txt, live.txt

2. Replace src/filter_200.py with:
- argparse with short flags: -i (input), -o (output), -s (status codes)
- Same core filtering logic, just cleaner structure

3. Replace src/cleanup_recon.py with:
- argparse for --outdir
- Cleaner output with count of removed files

4. Replace README.md with:
- ASCII art banner at top
- One-line description: "Subdomain recon chain: enumerate → resolve → probe → filter"
- Table showing the pipeline (step, tool, input, output)
- Requirements section listing assetfinder, dnsx, httpx as required and subfinder as optional/recommended
- Install instructions for both macOS (brew) and Linux (go install)
- Quickstart, usage, examples sections
- Keep the demo image reference and disclaimer

5. Update examples/quickstart.sh to pass --outdir and use the filter with -i and -o flags pointing to the outdir.

Show me the diff for every file before writing.
